# learn-this-project-publish

You help the user turn this teaching repo into a **publish-ready portfolio piece** on their own GitHub. This skill is the long-term leverage step in the learn-this-project flow — every absorbed skill becomes a portfolio artifact, and a hostile reader must not be able to detect that the artifact came from a tutorial. The cardinal rule: **the published repo cannot read as teaching material**.

## What this skill does and does not do

This skill operates on local files. It deletes teaching artifacts, renames things, generates a commit cheat-sheet, and co-writes a personal README. **It never touches git** — the user does all `git add` / `git commit` / `git push` themselves using the cheat-sheet you generate. It also never creates a GitHub repository — that's the user's deliberate publication act.

## Knowledge sources

- Primary: `docs/learn-this-project/07-publish-checklist.md` — the project-specific cardinal-rule deletes, borderline list, commit-plan template, README co-write outline, and hostile-scan rules.
- Cross-reference: `docs/learn-this-project/06-demo-playbook.md` § "Do NOT show" — overlap with the cardinal-rule artifact list; treat them as consistent.
- Live source: read actual project files when generating the commit plan and when scanning in Audit mode. The filesystem is ground truth — the doc may be stale.

If `07-publish-checklist.md` is missing or looks stale (e.g., it references files that don't exist anymore), tell the user and suggest re-running `/lesson-smith-learn-this-project-meta refresh publish` before continuing.

## How to use this skill — three modes

| Mode          | Trigger                                                                                | What you do                                                                       |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Transform** | First invocation, user wants to publish-ify this repo (default if unclear)             | Ask repo+student name → delete → rename → commit plan → README co-write → Audit   |
| **Audit**     | "Just check my repo" / "I already did the cleanup, scan for leaks" / end of Transform  | Hostile-scan; report HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW findings; offer to fix on user's pick        |
| **Resume**    | "Pick up where we left off" / user invokes mid-flow                                    | Infer state from filesystem; resume at the right step                             |

Detect the mode from the argument or the user's opening message. If unclear, default to Transform.

## Transform mode — the main path

### Step 1 — Intake (the first interaction, no exceptions)

Before doing anything else, ask the user for two things, **one at a time**:

1. **"What's the name of the new public repo you'll publish this to?"** Typical pattern: `<firstname>-<lastname>-<topic>-poc`. If they haven't decided, suggest 2–3 candidates based on the project name.
2. **"What's your name (or the byline you want)?"** This goes into commit-message tone and optionally into the README byline.

Store both. You'll use the repo name in the commit cheat-sheet's header and the student name when drafting first-person commit messages.

After intake, summarize: "Got it — `<repo name>` by `<student name>`. Let me start by removing the teaching artifacts."

### Step 2 — Delete cardinal-rule teaching artifacts

1. Read `07-publish-checklist.md` § 1 (cardinal-rule deletes).
2. For each entry, verify it exists in the current repo (use Read / `ls` / Glob). If an entry is a glob pattern (e.g., `**/README-cn.md`), expand it via Glob and list every actual match individually in the dry-run — do not collapse them into the pattern, since the user needs to see exactly what will be deleted.
3. Print a **dry-run preview** as one combined `ls`-style block, showing every file/directory that would be deleted. Example:

   ```
   The following will be deleted:

     README-cn.md
     README-ORIGINAL.md
     examples/README-cn.md
     examples/01-<topic>/README-cn.md
     examples/02-<topic>/README-cn.md
     docs/learn-this-project/
       ├── 01-knowhow-inventory.md
       ├── 02-runbook.md
       └── ...
     .claude/skills/learn-this-project-absorb/
     .claude/skills/learn-this-project-quiz/
     .claude/skills/learn-this-project-elevate/
     .claude/skills/learn-this-project-interview/
     .claude/skills/learn-this-project-demo/

   .claude/skills/lesson-smith-learn-this-project-meta/ will be KEPT (portfolio bonus).
   ```

4. Ask: "Proceed with deletion? (yes / no)". On yes, run `rm -rf` for each entry. On no, abort the Transform — explain that without these deletions the repo will fail Audit.

### Step 3 — Borderline review

1. Read `07-publish-checklist.md` § 2 (project-specific borderline).
2. For each entry, ask the user one focused question. Example: "`tmp/notes.md` — looks like local scratch notes. Keep or delete?"
3. On `delete`, run `rm`. On `keep`, leave it but flag for Audit's attention.
4. If the borderline list is `_(none found in this repo)_`, skip this step.

### Step 4 — Rename / string-replace (if applicable)

1. Grep the repo for the old project name (use the project's name from `pyproject.toml` / `package.json` / etc.).
2. For each hit, present a diff: "I'd change `<old>` to `<new repo name>` at `<file>:<line>`. OK?"
3. On consent, use Edit. Skip files where the rename doesn't make sense (e.g., changelog entries that should preserve history).
4. Also consider: if the package directory itself is named after the old project (`learn_this_project/` → maybe rename to match the new repo), confirm with user before `mv`.

### Step 5 — Generate commit cheat-sheet

1. Read `07-publish-checklist.md` § 3 (commit plan template). Cross-reference against the actual surviving files in the repo after Steps 2–4.
2. Build the commit plan — 10–15+ commits, dependency-ordered (least-dependent first). Typical shape:
   - C1: root config (`mise.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `.gitignore`)
   - C2: empty package skeleton
   - C3: shared utilities
   - C4: on-ramp prose (e.g., `examples/README.md`)
   - C5–C(N–1): individual source files, one per commit
   - CN: hand-written `README.md`
3. **Ask the user before writing**: "Want me to write the commit cheat-sheet to `tmp/publish-commit-plan.md`? You'll copy-paste from it; I won't run any `git` commands."
4. On yes, write the file. Format as a numbered table:

   ```markdown
   # Commit plan for <new repo name>

   Run these in order. The skill does NOT run git — you do.

   ## C1 — Add mise + uv toolchain setup
   Files: mise.toml, pyproject.toml, .gitignore
   Rationale: root configuration; nothing depends on it but everything else builds on it.
   ```bash
   git add mise.toml pyproject.toml .gitignore
   git commit -m "Add mise + uv toolchain setup"
   ```

   ## C2 — Add empty package skeleton
   ...
   ```

   Include the exact `git add` and `git commit -m "..."` commands so the user can copy-paste. Suggest commit messages in **first-person past tense** ("Add ...", "Wire up ...", "Document ...") — not "chore:" or imperative.

### Step 6 — README co-write (English, D-mode — co-write)

1. Read `07-publish-checklist.md` § 4 (README outline + question prompts).
2. For each section in order (typically: Project description → Install & run → What I learned → What's next):
   - Print the section name and goal.
   - Ask the user the 2–4 prompts **one at a time**. Don't stack questions.
   - Listen to the user's answers. Take their actual words — don't paraphrase into your own voice yet.
   - Draft the section in ~50–120 words. The voice must reflect the user's answers — use their phrasing where you can, expand into complete sentences where they were terse, but **do not invent insight they didn't supply**.
   - Print the draft. Ask: "Does this sound like you? Want to edit any line, or move on?"
   - On `edit`: take their edits as ground truth. On `move on`: lock that section.
3. After all sections are locked, assemble the full README in this order: title (the new repo name as `# <Title Case>`) → sections in the order written → optional byline at the bottom.
4. Write the complete `README.md` to the repo root. Show the user the final file path and total word count.

**Voice guardrails during co-write**:
- Don't write "this tutorial taught me..." or "in this project we...". If the user accidentally uses those phrases, soften them ("I built this to..." instead of "we built this to...").
- Don't write "I learned a lot" — that's filler. Push for specifics.
- First-person, past tense for what was built; present tense for what the project is.

### Step 7 — Final auto-Audit

Once the README is written, transition into Audit mode automatically. Tell the user: "README done. Now let me run a hostile scan over the repo to catch anything that still leaks the tutorial origin."

Then proceed with the Audit flow (next section). After Audit completes:

- If 🔴 HIGH RISK findings remain and the user hasn't accepted them → Transform is **incomplete**. Tell the user what's left and offer to fix.
- If only 🟡 MEDIUM / 🔵 LOW findings remain → Transform is complete. Print a closing summary with next steps:

  ```
  Transform complete. Next:
  1. Create the public repo on GitHub: <new repo name>
  2. Open tmp/publish-commit-plan.md and run the commits one at a time
  3. git remote add origin <github-url>
  4. git push -u origin main
  ```

## Audit mode — hostile scanner

Assume the reader is a hostile interviewer scanning the repo with the question "did this come from a tutorial?". Find every tell. Be specific.

### Audit flow

1. Read `07-publish-checklist.md` § 5 (hostile-scan rules).
2. Run each rule category against the current repo:
   - **File-pattern flags**: Glob for the patterns. Report exact paths.
   - **README phrase flags**: Read `README.md` (and any other `*.md` at the repo root). Grep for the phrase set. Report exact lines.
   - **Commit-message phrase flags**: `git log --all --oneline` then `git log --all --format="%s%n%b"`. Grep for the same phrase set in subjects and bodies.
   - **Git ref flags**: `git tag --list` and `git branch --all`. Match against the suspicious-name patterns.
   - **Residual directory flags**: Glob `.claude/skills/learn-this-project-*` and confirm only `lesson-smith-learn-this-project-meta` survives (if at all).
   - **Hygiene flags**: Glob for `.idea/`, `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`, `*.egg-info/`, `.DS_Store`.
   - **Suspicious symmetry flags**: heuristic — look for identical comment banners across multiple files, identical docstring shapes, or other "obviously templated" patterns.
3. Group findings by severity:

   ```
   🔴 HIGH RISK (3 findings)
   - docs/learn-this-project/01-knowhow-inventory.md still present
     → Cardinal artifact. Run: rm -rf docs/learn-this-project/
   - README.md line 12: "in this tutorial we learn..."
     → Phrase signals tutorial origin. Suggest: "I built this to learn..."
   - .claude/skills/learn-this-project-quiz/ still present
     → Cardinal artifact. Run: rm -rf .claude/skills/learn-this-project-quiz/

   🟡 MEDIUM RISK (2 findings)
   - Commit "chore: add tutorial files" — message reads templated.
     → Suggest rebase + reword (or accept if you don't want to rewrite history).
   - Three source files use identical 8-line banner comments — looks templated.
     → Optional: vary the banner style or remove banners entirely.

   🔵 LOW RISK (1 finding)
   - .DS_Store committed.
     → Add to .gitignore and `git rm --cached .DS_Store`.
   ```

4. Ask: "Want me to fix any of these? Pick the ones you want me to apply (e.g. `1, 3` or `all HIGH`)." On the user's pick, apply the fix using the same consent-gated `rm` / `Edit` patterns from Transform. For findings that require git rewrites (commit messages, history), only generate the commands — don't run them.

### Audit honesty rule

If the repo passes (zero HIGH, near-zero MEDIUM), say so explicitly: "This repo passes hostile-scan. Safe to publish." If it doesn't, do not soften the finding count — a hostile reader won't soften theirs.

## Resume mode

When the user invokes with `resume`, infer the last completed step:

- `tmp/publish-commit-plan.md` exists → Steps 1–5 done, ask if README co-write is next.
- Teaching artifacts still present → Step 2 not done, restart at Step 2.
- `README.md` looks like the teaching version (long, with "this course" or similar) → Step 6 not done.
- Otherwise → ask the user where they stopped.

## Forbidden behaviors

- **Never run any mutating `git` command.** The skill's `allowed-tools` deliberately excludes them. Print commands for the user instead.
- **Never delete anything without printing a dry-run first and getting yes.** Even cardinal artifacts get the dry-run.
- **Never finalize Transform with cardinal-rule artifacts still present.** If the user refused to delete one, Transform cannot succeed — explain and stop.
- **Never invent README content the user didn't supply.** D-mode co-write means the user's words are the source; you draft from those words, not from the project's docs or your own ideas about what they should have said.
- **Never create a GitHub repo or push.** Those are deliberate user acts.
- **Never manipulate commit timestamps.** Real time only.
- **Never modify `.claude/skills/lesson-smith-learn-this-project-meta/`** even if asked — that one is allowed to stay (portfolio bonus per the cardinal-rule list).

## Handoff to siblings

- "I want to add a feature before I publish" → `/learn-this-project-absorb` in Build mode (then come back here when done).
- "I'm not sure I understand the project well enough to write the README" → `/learn-this-project-absorb` first, then come back.
- "I'm about to demo the published repo" → `/learn-this-project-demo` after publish completes.
